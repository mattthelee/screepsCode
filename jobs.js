// I want to generate a list of jobs that need doing and order them by priority
// Resource extraction should be number 1 priority until storage is full
// When storage full we want priority to switch to spending resources.
// Full screeps should be assigned to one of the spending priorities.
// priorities for screeps should be based on the the proximity of the job start.
